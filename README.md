# Rental-Bikes-Predictor-using-kNN-and-RFR
The projectâ€™s main focus is predicting the number of rental bikes required at each hour in order to maintain a steady supply. It discusses ways in which we can predict the number of bikes needed for the particular day based on the provided data set. These type of prediction systems enable users to borrow a bike from a specific location and return it to a different location. Hence, we use machine learning to predict the number of rental bikes that are needed on a particular day. Therefore, this project uses Ridge Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine for Regression, Random Forest Method for Regression and Gradient Boosted Regression Tree for the prediction of rental bikes.
